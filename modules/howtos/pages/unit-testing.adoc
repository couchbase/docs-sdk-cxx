By default, a mock cluster is used for testing. If you wish to use a real cluster, you can define the TEST_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable (e.g. TEST_CONNECTION_STRING=couchbase://localhost). You might also need to set the values for the TEST_USERNAME, TEST_PASSWORD, and TEST_BUCKET environment variables.

To run the tests:

$ bundle exec rake test
