Our xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk[Getting Started pages] cover the basics of making a connection to a Capella or self-managed Couchbase cluster.
This page is a wider look at the topic.


== Connecting to a Cluster


A connection to a Couchbase cluster -- on Capella, or self-managed -- is represented by a cluster object. 
A cluster provides access to buckets, scopes, and collections, as well as various Couchbase services and management interfaces. 
The simplest way to create a `cluster` object is to call `couchbase::cluster::connect()` with a connection string, username, and password:

[source,{example-source-lang}]
----
include::{example-source}[indent=0,tag=connect_line]
----


And here it is in the context of a full connection lifecycle:

[source,{example-source-lang}]
----
include::{example-source}[indent=0,tag=connection_lifecycle]
----

If this were compiled as `start_using`, then the connection string and authentication credentials would be passed as arguments to the command like so:

[source,console]
---- 
$ ./start_using couchbase://127.0.0.1 Administrator password
----

Here we're talking to a local development cluster.
For Capella, this will need `couchbases://` for TLS, followed by your Capella cluster name -- see xref:cloud:get-started:connect.adoc[].
The client certificate for connecting to Capella is included in the {name-SDK} installation.




== Connection Strings

A Couchbase connection string is a comma-delimited list of IP addresses and/or hostnames, optionally followed by a list of parameters.

The parameter list is just like the query component of a URI; name-value pairs have an equals sign (`=`) separating the name and value, with an ampersand (`&`) between each pair.
Just as in a URI, the first parameter is prefixed by a question mark (`?`).

.Simple connection string with one seed node
----
127.0.0.1
----

.Connection string with two seed nodes
----
nodeA.example.com,nodeB.example.com
----

.Connection string with two parameters
----
127.0.0.1?network=external&key_value_timeout=10s
----

For the {cpp} SDK and its wrapper SDKs, this is the main method of passing client options, such as timeout options or I/O options.
For more details see xref:ref:client-settings.adoc[], or the latest, complete listing in the 
// ###
[API Reference].



== Secure Connections



Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition and Couchbase Capella support full encryption of client-side traffic using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

== Dealing With Network Latency






=== Working in the Cloud

// include::{version-common}@sdk:shared:partial$managing-connections.adoc[tag=cloud]


We strongly recommend that the client and server xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[are in the same LAN-like environment] (e.g. AWS Region).
As this may not always be possible during development, read the guidance on working with xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#commonly-used-options[constrained network environments].
More details on connecting your client code to Couchbase Capella can be found xref:cloud:clouds:connect-an-sdk.adoc#connecting-your-sdk-to-capella[in the Cloud docs].

// Add WAN profile info

IMPORTANT: If you are connecting from _IPv6-only_ environment, you cannot connect to Couchbase Capella as you are unable to use the IPv4 records published for Capella clusters.



==== Troubleshooting Connections to Cloud

Some DNS caching providers (notably, home routers) can’t handle an SRV record that’s large -- if you have DNS-SRV issues with such a set-up, reduce your DNS-SRV to only include three records.
[_For development only, not production._]. 
Our xref:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc[Troubleshooting Cloud Connections] page will help you to diagnose this and other problems -- as well as introducing the SDK doctor tool.


== Complex Environments

== Alternate Addresses and Custom Ports



If your Couchbase Server cluster is running in a containerized, port mapped, or otherwise NAT’d environment like Docker or Kubernetes, 
a client running outside that environment may need additional information in order to connect the cluster. 
Both the client and server require special configuration in this case.



=== Using DNS SRV records

As an alternative to specifying multiple hosts in your program, you can get the actual bootstrap node list from a DNS SRV record. The following steps are necessary to make it work:

. Set up your DNS server to respond properly from a DNS SRV request.
. Enable it on the SDK and point it towards the DNS SRV entry.
