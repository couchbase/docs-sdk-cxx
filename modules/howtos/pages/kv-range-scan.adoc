Couchbase documents are accessed from the Data Service by Key, and if your data contains sequential keys, such as dates or geo-location data (co-ordinates, Zip codes, etc.), then scanning a range of keys is much faster than a query using {sqlpp}.
This is because our Data (K-V) Service uses a fast binary protocol.

If your document's keys cannot be arranged to take advantage of Key-Value Range Scans, then look instead at our xref:howtos:sqlpp-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query Service],
otherwise read on.
