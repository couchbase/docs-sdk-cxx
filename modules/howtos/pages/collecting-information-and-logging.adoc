The Couchbase {cpp} SDK has no hard dependency on a specific logger implementation.
By default it uses built-in means to report events.
The default log level is `warning`.

The following log levels are supported (in order of increasing amount of information logged):

. off
. critical
. error
. warning
. info
. debug
. trace

The {cpp} SDK is configured to send logs to standard output.
The logging level can be changed using the environment variable `COUCHBASE_BACKEND_LOG_LEVEL`.

?? or can it ??
