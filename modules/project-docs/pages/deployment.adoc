One of Couchbase's strengths is speedy response, so deployment of apps should be in the same
AZ?
as the Server -- whether Capella, or your own self-managed cluster.

We always recommend the 
xref:relnote
[latest version] of the SDK. This not only contains the latest security updates and bug fixes, but will be compatible with the latest Couchbase Server release.
Note, Capella always runs a recent version of Couchbase Server.





Before deploying, take note of any 
xref:compat
[compatibility] issues for the language platform and underlying OS.
The 
xref:sdk-full-installation.adoc
[full installation guide] should cover any special cases for all supported environments.
