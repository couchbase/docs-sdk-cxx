This page gives full installation instructions for the {name-sdk}.
In most cases, the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Quickstart Guide] should be enough to get you up and running if you're in a hurry.

== Prerequisites

A {cpp} 17 compiler and https://cmake.org/[CMake] version 3.19 or newer is required. See the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc[Compatibility] section for details on supported platforms.

== Installing the SDK

=== With CPM.cmake

https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake[CPM.cmake] makes it really easy to include the library in your project. You only need to include the following command in your `CMakeLists.txt`.
